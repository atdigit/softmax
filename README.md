# Softmax in 3D (Three classes visualisation example)
Softmax Function 3D Visualization
Description: This repository is dedicated to the 3D visualization of the softmax function. Here, you’ll find the code that showcases the power of the softmax function, a crucial tool in machine learning for classification and decision-making. 

Check out our educational video [“AI Talk: Unveiling the Softmax Function — The AI Decision-Maker”](https://youtu.be/RaVu5dFzYHw?si=x5uQgDtpdNmohjPU) for a detailed explanation of this key concept. Also available is a Google Colab notebook where you can run the code yourself and see the visualization in action.

Main code is here.
